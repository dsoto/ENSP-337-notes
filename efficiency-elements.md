# Heat Pumps

- Heat pumps can move thermal energy from cold materials to warmer
    materials
- This is the opposite direction from conduction
- Mosts thermal energy in buildings is released through combustion
- It can be more efficient to move thermal energy from outside the house
    to inside the house

# Insulation

- Insulation slows the movement of thermal energy
- We may wish to trap thermal energy inside a building in a cold climate
- In summer, you want to prevent thermal energy from entering a building

# Ventilation

- Buildings must provide a certain level of fresh air to support human
    health
- In a cold climate, this means bringing in cold air from the outside
- This cold air must be heated, requiring energy
- Air to air heat exchangers can use the outgoing warm air to preheat
    the incoming air, reducing the heating load

# Monitoring

- Buildings often use more energy than their designers intended
- An important efficiency tool is the monitoring of a building for
    energy use
- By comparing energy use between similar days, we can look for changes
    in performance because of technical or behavioral causes.
- Similar days can mean temperature, number of occupants, or other
    factors
