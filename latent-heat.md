# Conceptual Questions

- Under normal conditions (atmospheric pressure) what are the temperatures at which you can have liquid water?
- What are the temperatures that you can have ice?
- What range of temperatures for ice water?
- What range of temperatures for boiling water?

# Learning Objectives

- Understand and calculate heat capacity to find energy needed to make phase changes.
- Describe phase changes like freezing, melting, evaporation, and condensation.

# Latent heat of fusion
- How much energy does it take to freeze a gram of water?
- What is the temperature of the water before and after freezing?

# Latent heat of vaporization
- How much energy does it take to boil a gram of water?
- What is the temperature of the water before and after boiling?

# Heat capacities

|       |                         |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Water | 4.18 J per g per Kelvin |
| Ice   | 2.11 J per g per Kelvin |
| Steam | 2.00 J per g per Kelvin |


# Phase change

During a phase change, the temperature stays the same.


# Latent heat

The amount of energy added or removed from material to change phase.

# Latent heats

|             |                   |
| ----------  | ---------------   |
| Evaporation | 2.26 kJ per gram  |
| Melting     | 0.334 kJ per gram |

# Relation to enthalpy

You may have seen these quantities referred to as enthalpy of fusion or the enthalpy of vaporization.
