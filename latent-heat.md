## Learning Objectives

- Understand and calculate heat capacity to find energy needed to make phase changes.
- Describe phase changes like freezing, melting, evaporation, and condensation.

## Heat capacities

|       |                         |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Water | 4.18 J per g per Kelvin |
| Ice   | 2.11 J per g per Kelvin |
| Steam | 2.00 J per g per Kelvin |


## Phase change

During a phase change, the temperature stays the same.


## Latent heat

The amount of energy added or removed from material to change phase.

## Latent heats

|           |              |
|----------|---------------|
| Evaporation | 2.26 kJ per gram   |
| Melting     | 0.334 kJ per gram    |
