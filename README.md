This is a set of notes for the ENSP 337 Thermal Energy Management class at Sonoma State University.
It will be developed over the course of the semester as a supplemental reading.


In this course, you will develop two skills.  One you will learn to pose
questions about energy as mathematical estimations.  These estimations
will help us understand if new technologies or policies can have a
positive impact on our energy system.  The second important skill is
that you will learn to use critical thinking skills in a quantitative
energy context.  When presented with an argument, you will be able to
determine if the argument has clear claims that are supported with
evidence.  These two skills are complementary.  Often, the evidence
supporting claims is quantitative and the skills you develop in
estimations will help you evaluate the quality of the evidence used to
support claims about new energy policies or technologies.


Often, the calculations in this class are used as the basis for an
investment by a company or a home-owner.  In order for this analysis to
be convincing, the details and method of the calculation must be clear.
You will learn how to document your calculations so that they are
comprehensible to others.
