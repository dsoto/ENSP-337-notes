# Water Heating

## Materials

- Electric Kettle
- Thermocouple and meter
- Electric power meter

## Description

- Develop intuitive description of heat energy being added to water internal energy
- Create an energy diagram with energy being added to water
- Translate to the heat capacity model $Q = UA \Delta T$
- Measure observables except for your prediction
- Ask class to make estimates of temperature rise or other observables


# Microwave water heating

## Description

- Determine how efficient a microwave is
- Measure water temp before
- Use microwave to add energy
- Measure the electrical energy consumed
- Use the end temperature to estimate the internal energy gained by the water
- Divide the two and estimate the efficiency
- Randos on the internet say about 50% efficient for a microwave





<!-- # Solar Concentrating Fresnel -->
<!-- Focus the concentrating lens and see if you can measure the temperature rise on a small block of rock or concrete or something with a thermocouple. -->





# EMD Gas Measurement and Degree Days

Monitor the gas meter and then measure the gas used.
Using the indoor temperature data and outdoor temperature data, calculate the HDD over the same period.

What is the natural gas volume per HDD?  CO2 per HDD?


# Passive Solar Model

## Materials

- Cardboard boxes
- Rigid foam insulation

## Description

- Students estimate the UA product, thermal mass, and glazing area needed to maintain an even temperature
- Students create an enclosure with the dimensions of their estimates
- We put these out with data loggers and measure the temperature inside and outside
- Students aggregate and plot this data and prepare a report of prediction and observation
- Students are given an opportunity to revise their models and estimates
- Students use an industry-standard tool to verify their envelope estimates?


# Estimation of Annual Gasoline Use

## Description

- Students construct a model based on US population, percent ownership, miles driven per year, and fuel efficiency.
- Usually estimates come well within a factor of two of the US value
- Note the simplifying assumptions being made (airplanes, 18-wheelers, etc)
- EIA has this in their [FAQ](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=23&t=10) as 140 billion gallons.


# Overall Learning Goals for Class

Break into groups and discuss why you are taking the class and what your learning goals are in the class.


# Existing Knowledge

For today's topic, discuss with your neighbor, what you already know about the topic.
How certain are you of your knowledge?

# Estimation

Guide the class through an estimation.
Start with no "givens".
As students decide what information they need, lead them on how to achieve it.
Then use an accepted value.

How much heating energy is used in homes each year in the US?

How much cooling energy is used in homes each year in the US?

How will climate change affect each of these?

How much CO2 is emitted in homes or for a given thermal use?


# Measurement of the ETC volume

## Description

- Using the dimensions of their bodies, students come up with estimates for the volume of the ETC
- We go through the simplifying assumptions (is your model a box?  are you including the clerestory?)
- The floor space can be paced off.
- The height of the ETC can be estimated with an eyed hand span technique with a student or meter stick along the wall.


<!-- # ETC CO2 Concentration -->
<!--  -->
<!-- This is an exercise in inference where we attempt to infer the number of -->
<!-- students in the ETC based on the observation of the carbon dioxide level -->
<!-- as measured by a sensor. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Assumptions -->
<!--  -->
<!-- 500 ml volume per breath -->
<!--  -->
<!-- 25,000 to 50,000 ppm CO2 in exhaled air -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Get class to brainstorm a way to measure the number of students in the -->
<!-- room from the CO2 reading. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Withhold information initially and provide it in response to student -->
<!-- questions.  Get them in groups to come up with possible ways and then -->
<!-- regroup. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- These could be estimated from student experience and intuition -->
<!--  -->
<!-- What is the volume of a breath? -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Number of breaths per minute -->
<!--  -->
<!-- The concentration in exhaled air should be given once asked since this -->
<!-- isn't an obvious number. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- I'm using 600 cubic meters for the volume of the ETC space -->
<!--  -->


# Estimation of ETC energy use

##  Introduce question, how much heat energy does the ETC use each year

- Ask students to come up with sub-questions
    - What is the UA product (estimate of 100 W/K)
    - What are the degree days per year (eyeball mean of 2200 with a base temp of 65F)
    - What does the gas meter say? (570 therms per year) data in ETC folder
- Students can then work on a sub-question and get estimates

Should we convert UA to BTU/hour/degree or to BTU per degree-day?

## We ask a further question, how much natural gas does it take to provide this heat energy

- Student sub-questions
    - What is the heat released burning gas
    - What is the efficiency of the furnace?

## How much carbon is released (per square foot per year?)

- CBECS 2012 is about 40 kBTU per square foot (per year?)
- See figure 3 https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/reports/2012/energyusage/
- Let's convert this to GJ per square meter per year? GJ per square foot per year?

## What if we went to heat pump?

- subquestions
    - coefficient of performance for a heat pump water heater
    - carbon intensity of electricity
