# Practical Elements

# Questions

- How do we apply the physics of heat transfer in practice?
- What elements of buildings can lower energy usage?

# Learning Objectives
- Calculate the energy used when a specified building element is used.

# Concepts

- Heating Degree Days
- Cooling Degree Days
- UA Product
- Balance Point
- Index

## UA Product

- power per temperature difference
- Total Heat loss coefficient (ASHRAE)
- Overall Heat Loss Factor (EFS)

This tells you how much thermal power must be delivered in order to
maintain a desired temperature difference.

## Balance Point

Any building has several internal sources of thermal energy.  The
lighting, occupants, and appliances all provide heat to the building.
The balance point tells us what temperature difference the building will
have between the outside temperature and the inside temperature without
providing any energy from the heating system.

## Time Step Calculations

If we have a known thermal mass surrounded by a known insulating
exterior and begin to heat the mass, what will the change in temperature
look like?

## Spectrally Selective Materials

In a cold climate, it would be advantageous to be able to absorb
sunlight very efficiently, but radiate heat very inefficiently.  What
properties would such a material have?

## Maximum Temperature

- Given a heater emitting a constant power, what is the equilibrium
    temperature for a home?
- For simple cases, we can estimate this from the UA product

$$ q = U A \Delta T $$
$$ \Delta T = T_{inside} - T_{outside} = q/UA $$

## Box Experiment

- Our temperature difference is about 13C (38C - 25C)
- The power in that trial was about 47 watts
- The UA product is then 3.6 watts per degree C
