Passive building design allows us to use heat from the environment or
the occupants to create a comfortable environment in a building.  This
will reduce the need to create heat from the combustion of fossil fuels
or electrical resistance heating.

## Spectrally Selective Materials

In a cold climate, it would be advantageous to be able to absorb
sunlight very efficiently, but radiate heat very inefficiently.  What
properties would such a material have?

## Maximum Temperature

- Given a heater emitting a constant power, what is the equilibrium
    temperature for a home?
- For simple cases, we can estimate this from the UA product

$$ q = U A \Delta T $$

$$ \Delta T = T_{inside} - T_{outside} = q/UA $$
