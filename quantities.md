In order for our mathematics to represent the physical world, we usually
have to attach a physical dimension
## Learning Objectives

- Perform simple and complex unit conversions
- Learn common energy units


## Physical Quantities
- Our numbers are often helping us represent physical quantities
- Examples:
    - The length of a tree
    - The number of animals observed
    - The number of molecules of mercury in a fish
- A physical quantity is expressed as the product of a unit and a
  numerical factor

## Dimensions
- These physical quantities often have a dimension
- Examples:
    - Length
    - Time
    - Mass

## Units
- To quantify dimensions, we use units
- One dimension may have multiple units
- Length: inches, miles, kilometers, light-years
- Mass: grams, pounds, kilograms
- There are also systems of units like SI or English

## Measurement
- Each measurement we make is an estimation of the physical quantity

## Consequences
- NASA Mars Climate Orbiter destroyed because of newton vs pounds of
force
- A cargo flight was lost in 1999 when crew confused meters and feet


## Unit conversion factors
- These factors are equivalent to one or unity and are dimensionless
- They are not numerically equal to one in most cases.
- Units can be crossed out
