## Direct Insolation

Radiation from direct sunlight.

## Diffuse Insolation

Radiation from reflected sunlight from either the ground or the sky.

## Global Insolation

Total radiation on a surface including direct and diffuse sources.

## Horizontal Insolation

This is the insolation on a surface parallel to the ground.

## Vertical Insolation

This is the insolation on a vertical surface, like a window.

## Incident Radiation

For a window, this is the radiation striking the outside surface.

## Transmitted Radiation

For a window, this is the radiation that is transmitted by the window into the interior space without being reflected or absorbed.

## Insolation Units and Dimensions

Insolation is usually reported in power or energy per area.
