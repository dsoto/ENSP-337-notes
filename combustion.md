# Combustion

# Concepts

## Enthalpy

Chemical compounds have an energy value that we can use to determine the energy released by a chemical reaction.

## Efficiency

The ratio of useful energy delivered to energy input.

## Carbon Intensity

The ratio of carbon released to the amount of energy delivered.

## Energy Density

The amount of heat energy released per mass of material combusted.

## High Heating Value

This is the amount of heat delivered per unit of combusted material that includes the energy from condensation of the water vapor.

## Low Heating Value

This is the amount of heat delivered per unit of combusted material when no condensation energy is captured.

## Heat Rate

The amount of chemical energy input to produce an amount of electrical energy.


# Combustion in Buildings

Combustion of natural gas is a widespread method of delivering heat to buildings.
For the purposes of climate change, we want to provide human comfort with the lowest possible emissions of greenhouse gases.

# Methane Combustion

- Methane + Oxygen -> Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy
- CH~4~ + 2O~2~ -> CO~2~ + 2H~2~O

# Moles

- One mole is 6.02 $$\times 10^{23}$$ molecules (or atoms) of a substance

# Molar Weights

| Material | Mass of one Mole (grams) |
| -        | -                        |
| Carbon   | 12                       |
| Oxygen   | 16                       |
| Hydrogen | 1                        |


# Mole Conversion

- One mole of methane burned equals one mole of CO~2~ released
- Conversion factor:
$$\frac{\textrm{1 mole carbon dioxide
    released}}{\textrm{1 mole methane burned}}$$


# Mass Conversion

- We need to know the masses of these to make a conversion factor for
    mass of carbon dioxide released to mass of methane burned
- What is the mass of one mole of methane?
- 12 grams per oxygen atom + 4 mole hydrogen * 1 gram per hydrogen mole = 16 grams
- What is the mass of carbon dioxide?
- 12 + 2 * 16 = 44 grams per mole

# Mass Conversion

- 16g CH~4~ + 64g 2O~2~ -> 44g CO~2~ + 36g 2H~2~O

# Enthalpy of Formation

| Substance      | Enthalpy (kJ/mol) |
| -              | -                 |
| Oxygen gas     | 0                 |
| Liquid water   | -285.8            |
| Water Vapor    | -241.8            |
| Methane        | -74.9             |
| Carbon Dioxide | -393.5            |

# Energy Released

- Change in enthalpy is the sum of products minus the sum of reactants
- -393.5 + 2 * -241.8 - (-74.9 + 2 * 0) = -802.2 kJ/mol CH~4~ burned
- This yields 50.1 kJ per gram
- Compare to the published value

# Carbon Tax

To create a market signal, you have to assign a monetary value to carbon.
The social cost of carbon calculations attempt to sum the costs created by carbon emissions.
Carbon taxes or cap and trade programs add a cost to transactions involving carbon.

One question we ask is how much does a carbon tax change the cost of services being delivered.

If a carbon tax is currently about 13 USD/tonne CO2 equivalent, how much would this change the cost of one therm of natural gas?
How about your monthly gas bill during the winter?

# Caveat

You need to be careful when you encounter numbers on carbon emissions.

- Some carbon dioxide emissions are listed as the mass of carbon
- Others are listed as the mass of carbon dioxide
- You can always convert between the two using the molecular weight
    ratio (44/12)

## Assumptions

- 100 cubic feet per therm
- 0.8 kg per cubic meter density of natural gas
- about $1 per therm


## Carbon Tax Calculation

    100 ft^3 * (1 m/3.3 ft)^3
             * 0.8 kg CH4/m^3
             * 44 kg CO2 / 16 kg CH4
             * 0.012 USD/kg CO2 => $0.0735

## Electricity Generation

Electricity is generated through the combustion of coal, natural gas, oil, or diesel.
Coal and natural gas combustion typically heats water into steam to turn a turbine connected to an electromagnetic generator.
Diesel electricity generation occurs in an internal combustion engine where the pistons turn a crankshaft that turns the generator.

For the purposes of cost and carbon calculations, we are interested in how much fuel is used to create a unit of electrical energy.
Generally, energy sources that have low cost and low carbon per unit of electricity are desirable.
