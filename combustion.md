## Methane Combustion

- Methane + Oxygen -> Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy
- CH~4~ + 2O~2~ -> CO~2~ + 2H~2~O

## Moles

- One mole is 6.02 $$\times 10^{23}$$ molecules (or atoms) of a substance

## Molar Weights

| Material | Mass of one Mole (grams) |
| -        | -                        |
| Carbon   | 12                       |
| Oxygen   | 16                       |
| Hydrogen | 1                        |


## Mole Conversion

- One mole of methane burned equals one mole of CO~2~ released
- Conversion factor:
$$\frac{\textrm{1 mole carbon dioxide
    released}}{\textrm{1 mole methane burned}}$$


## Mass Conversion

- We need to know the masses of these to make a conversion factor for
    mass of carbon dioxide released to mass of methane burned
- What is the mass of one mole of methane?
- 12 grams per oxygen atom + 4 mole hydrogen * 1 gram per hydrogen mole = 16 grams
- What is the mass of carbon dioxide?
- 12 + 2 * 16 = 44 grams per mole

## Mass Conversion

- 16g CH~4~ + 64g 2O~2~ -> 44g CO~2~ + 36g 2H~2~O

## Enthalpy of Formation

| Substance      | Enthalpy (kJ/mol) |
| -              | -                 |
| Oxygen gas     | 0                 |
| Liquid water   | -285.8            |
| Water Vapor    | -241.8            |
| Methane        | -74.9             |
| Carbon Dioxide | -393.5            |

## Energy Released

- Change in enthalpy is the sum of products minus the sum of reactants
- -393.5 + 2 * -241.8 - (-74.9 + 2 * 0) = -802.2 kJ/mol CH~4~ burned
- This yields 50.1 kJ per gram
- Compare to the published value

## Carbon Tax

- currently about 13 USD/tonne CO2 equivalent
- How much would this change the cost of one therm of natural gas?

## Caveat

- Some carbon dioxide emissions are listed as the mass of carbon
- Others are listed as the mass of carbon dioxide
- You can always convert between the two using the molecular weight
    ratio (44/12)

### Assumptions

- 100 cubic feet per therm
- 0.8 kg per cubic meter density of natural gas
- about $1 per therm


## Carbon Tax Calculation

    100 ft^3 * (1 m/3.3 ft)^3
             * 0.8 kg CH4/m^3
             * 44 kg CO2 / 16 kg CH4
             * 0.012 USD/kg CO2 => $0.0735

## Electricity Generation

Electricity is generated through the combustion of coal, natural gas, oil, or diesel.
Coal and natural gas combustion typically heats water into steam to turn a turbine connected to an electromagnetic generator.
Diesel electricity generation occurs in an internal combustion engine where the pistons turn a crankshaft that turns the generator.

For the purposes of cost and carbon calculations, we are interested in how much fuel is used to create a unit of electrical energy.
Generally, energy sources that have low cost and low carbon per unit of electricity are desirable.
