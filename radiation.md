# Radiation
- Why do you think radiant heat is important?
- Where do you observe radiant heat?
- What wavelengths are involved?


# Thermal radiation

- What wavelengths do we refer to with thermal radiation?
- Why?

# Using Thermal Radiation

- If we want something to absorb thermal radiation, what properties are necessary?
- If we want something to shed thermal radiation?
- What if we want to use sunlight to warm something?
- What if we want light but not heat?

# Blackbody radiation

- What does the spectrum of radiation look like for the sun?
    - Which part of this is thermal?
- What does the spectrum of radiation look like for the earth?
    - Which part of this is thermal?

# Planck's law

- How do the wavelengths emitted changes as a substance increases in temperature?

## Planck's law

This law relates the intensity of power at each wavelength with the temperature
of an object (ideal black-body).

$$B_\lambda(\lambda, T) =\frac{2 hc^2}{\lambda^5}\frac{1}{ e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k_\mathrm{B}T}} - 1} $$

## Stefan-Boltzmann law

- What predicts the total radiant power from a hot object?

## Stefan-Boltzmann law

This law relates the total power emitted to the temperature, surface area, and emissivity of an object.

$$ P = A \epsilon \sigma T^4 $$

## Emissivity

The emissivity is how much radiant power is emitted by a substance relative to
an ideal black-body emitter.

If we have two objects with the same surface area and temperature, the object with the higher emissivity emits more radiation.

# Absorptivity

Kirchoff's Law of thermal radiation states that a body in thermodynamic equilibrium, the absorptivity and emissivity are equal.
