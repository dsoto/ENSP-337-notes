# Glazing

- Allows solar radiation to enter the interior of the home
- Blocks heat from escaping the building

# Thermal Mass

- Allows the storage of thermal energy
- Could be from day to night
- Some systems store from summer to winter
- Materials with high heat capacity are best

# Mass to Glazing Ratio

- It is important to balance the solar gain from windows with the
    storage of that thermal energy
- Insufficient storage can cause temperatures that are too high during
    the day
- The mass to glazing ratio provides a design guideline

# Passive Airflow

- Uses buoyancy of warm air to create currents of air
- Often used for cooling

# Internal loads

- Occupants and machines often create significant amounts of heat
- This heat can be used for conditioning a space
