# Heat Capacity

Some materials require more energy to be added or removed for the same temperature change as other materials.
This property is call heat capacity.

Note that large objects (an ocean being warmed by climate change) can store lots of energy for a small change in temperature.
Also note that for equal masses, some materials require less energy for a change in temperature.
To understand this we use the terms intensive and extensive.

# Intensive vs Extensive Properties

- Intensive or bulk property
    - Does not depend on the amount of material
    - Example: temperature, density
- Extensive property
    - Depends on the amount of material
    - Example: mass, volume

# Heat Capacity

- When heat moves from one material to another one temperature rises the other falls
- The temperature rise occurs as heat increases the motion of atoms in the material
- The rate of change in temperature with added energy is dictated by the heat capacity
- Ratio of heat added to temperature change

## Heat Capacity

- Extensive property (of the material and the amount)
- Measured in Joules per degree Kelvin


## Specific Heat Capacity

- Intensive property (of the material only)
- Measured in Joules per mass per degree Kelvin


## Table of Specific Heat Values

| Material | Heat Capacity (Joule/gram/kelvin) |
| --       | --                                |
| Air      | 1                                 |
| Water    | 4.1813                            |
| Iron     | 0.45                              |
| Aluminum | 0.897                             |
| Brick    | 0.840                             |
| Wood     | 1.2 - 2.9                         |

Partial list from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity


## Heat capacity

We have an equation that tells us how the energy absorbed by a material is related to the temperature rise.

$$ Q = mc\Delta T $$

- $$Q$$ is energy transferred to or from substance
- $$m$$ is the mass
- $$c$$ is the specific heat capacity
- $$\Delta T$$ is the temperature change

## Relation to Buildings

- Thermal mass is added to a building to store heat


## Relation to Weather and Climate

- The heat capacity of water affects the climate in some areas
