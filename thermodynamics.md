# Thermodynamics

## Concepts
- Temperature
- Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin Scale
- Heat Capacity
- First Law of Thermodynamics
- Second Law of Thermodynamics
- Energy Efficiency

## Concepts
- Carnot cycle heat engine
- Carnot refrigerator
- Carnot efficiency
- Coefficient of performance for refrigeration
- Coefficient of performance for heating
- What is the carbon difference for heat pump vs combustion


## Temperature
- Measure of the internal energy in a system or material
- This energy is the motion, vibration, or rotation of atoms and
  molecules

## Heat Engine
- Heat engines convert thermal energy to mechanical kinetic energy
- This conversion can never be 100 percent efficient

## Heat Engine
- Coal power plant turbines
- Internal combustion engines

## Heat Engines
- The heat engine is a mathematical model
- Takes the heat (flow) between two thermal reservoirs and converts some of
  that heat to work
- Heat can come from combustion or natural sources of heat

## Heat Engines
- A heat engine is more efficient when it uses a wider temperature range
    between the hot and cold sides

## Second Law of Thermodynamics
- The amount of entropy (disorder) in a closed system always increases
- Heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold
- "You can't break even"

## Thermodynamic limit to heat engine
- Carnot derived the upper limit of efficiency for a heat engine
$$\eta = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}$$
- This law dictates the maximum possible efficiency for power plants
- Some of the heat must be released into the environment

<!--
what happens when T_C goes to zero?
what happens when T_C and T_H are close to each other?

## Carnot Heat Engine
- The most efficient heat engine possible uses a Carnot cycle
- Heat is used to expand a gas and do work and heat is removed during
  the compression of the gas.

## Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
- If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system,
  they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.
- Real world example: Coffee gets cold, ice cream melts

## First Law of Thermodynamics
- Energy is conserved
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed
- "You can't get something for nothing"

## First Law Efficiency
- Most commonly used measure of efficiency
- Useful energy out divided by total energy in

## Coefficient of Performance

## Maximum COP

For refrigeration
$$ COP_R = \frac{T_C}{T_H - T_C} $$

For a heat pump
$$ COP_{HP} = \frac{T_H}{T_H - T_C} $$





## Activity

- Show that one kilowatt-hour is equal to 3.6 MJ.
