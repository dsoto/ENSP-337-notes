Heat pumps use the vapor-phase compression cycle to move thermal energy from a cold place to a hot place, in the opposite flow of nature.
These are usually powered by electricity

# SEER

The efficacy of the movement of heat to the consumption of electricity for cooling is quantified by the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER).

$$ SEER = \frac{\textrm{BTU cooling provided}}{\textrm{Watt-hours of electricity expended}} $$

# HSPF

The ratio of electricity required to the heat moved is given by the Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (HSPF).

$$ HSPF = \frac{\textrm{BTU cooling provided}}{\textrm{Watt-hours of electricity expended}} $$
