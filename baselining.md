Buildings often use more energy than what the architect expects.  This
is due to many factors including human behavior and the way the building
was actually constructed.

The practice of measuring the performance of a building over time is
often called "baselining" of a building.

# Gathering data

- Cumulative vs incremental readings

# Analyzing data

- How do you move from a cumulative reading to an incremental reading?
- Spedometer vs Odometer
- Discrete differences on the computer

# Visualizing data

- How do you display the energy use of a building
- What metrics are most important?  (per sq ft?, total?)

# Comparing performance

- How do you compare to previous performance
- How do you account for differences in the weather
- For differences in occupancy?
- What do linear multivariate regression models look like?

# Predicting Energy Use

- How much energy do you expect a building to use?
- What depends on the design of the building?
- What depends on the behavior of the occupants?
