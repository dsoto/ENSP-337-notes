This course discusses how the fundamental mechanisms of thermal energy generation and transfer influence human society.

A significant fraction of our carbon emissions are from keeping the temperature of our buildings different than the outside temperature.
Also, thermal processes dictate the efficiency of combustion engines and many electrical power plants.

Mastery of these concepts allows us to create dwellings and systems that provide the benefits we require with the minimum carbon emissions and disruption to our climate.

In cold climates, energy bills from heating can be a significant financial burden on lower-income households.
Some areas run programs that simultaneously address these problems of income and energy while providing job training for under-employed areas.

Importantly, the mechanisms of climate change can be understood through the mechanisms of heat transfer.
Sunlight warms our earth, which "glows" thermal radiation which is reflected by the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere back to the earth.
This effect helps make the earth inhabitable, but adding too much carbon is trapping more warmth than we think is safe.
