# Chapter 2

Basic physics and mathematics of energy



<!-- look at toolkits for examples
come up with exercises for the class
that will be turned in at the end
-->

## Learning Objectives
- You will learn to use quantitative tools to express energy


## Guiding Questions
- How do we express very large and very small numbers?
- How can we make estimates with very little information?

## Scientific Notation
- Allows us to compactly write very large or very small numbers

## A very large number
- Avogadro's Number
- $$6.02 \times 10^{23}$$
- $$10^{1}$$ = 10
- $$10^{2} = 10 \times 10$$
- $$10^{3} = 10 \times 10 \times 10$$

## A very small number
- Gravitational Constant
- $$6.67 \times 10^{-11} (m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2})$$
- $$10^{-1} = \frac{1}{10}$$
- $$10^{-2} = \frac{1}{10 \times 10}$$
- $$10^{-3} = \frac{1}{10 \times 10 \times 10}$$

<!-- name some common units using these prefixes -->

## Operations

- from IPCC Energy Primer

## Energy Units
- Joule
    - SI Unit.  One Newton-Meter.
- Kilowatt-Hour
    - Energy consumed by 1 kW load over one hour
- Calorie
    - Energy to heat one gram of water one degree Celsius
- Kilo-calorie
    - One thousand calories.  Used in food energy content.
- British Thermal Unit (BTU)
    - Energy to heat one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit
- Quad
    - One quadrillion ($10^{15}$) BTU

## Unit Conversions
- We may wish to compare energy units that are not consistent
- Often you can look up conversions in a table
- Other times you may need to recreate the conversion


## Back of the Envelope Calculations
- Construct a model of appropriate complexity
- Gather estimates of necessary quantities
- Calculate estimate
- Evaluate for feasibility

## Exercise
- Estimate the yearly use of gasoline in the US
- What is our strategy?

## Exercise
- How many gallons do you consume?
- How many persons in the US?


## Performing computations

While we want to develop our intuition when we are estimating with large
numbers, performing accurate calculations is also important.  You will
be able to calculate these numbers on a hand-held calculator, in Excel,
and using scientific computing platforms like Python or Julia.
