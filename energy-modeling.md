# Energy Modeling

## Data

- Traditionally, field has focused on building design
- We are now paying more attention to building operation
- This requires ways to observe and analyze data

## Forward Models

- Estimate the UA product from the measurements and ideal thermal
    conductivities

## Data Driven Models

- Estimate the UA product from the equilibrium temperature

## Data Examples

- NetAtmo
- Digit

## Box Model

- Simple cardboard box with heater
- What do we expect the temperature rise to be?
- Draw a graph in your notes with your basic prediction
- We will take data and compare to our predictions


## Tree Discussion

- How do we decompose complex problems?
- Tree technique following Mahajan

## Review

- What did we do last time?
- Calculated the heat loss coefficient of our box by two methods
- Method one: observation of equilibrium temperature
- Method two: estimation from measurements and ideal R-values

## Warm-Up

- You are in a car with a watch and a clear view of the spedometer but
    the odometer is broken
- How do you estimate how far you have traveled?

## Draw a diagram

- How would you think about this graphically
- Graph total milage vs time
- Graph speed vs time

## Energy Balance

- First Law of Thermodynamics must be obeyed
- Where is the thermal energy in our system?

## Diagram

- Where are the thermal energy inputs and outputs in our system?

## Mathematical model

- Start by setting the energies equal to each other

$$ E_{in} = E_{out} $$

- Then add heat loss equation and thermal mass equation
- Can you solve to find the temperature?

## Written notes

There are many notes from the board today necessary to understand the
lecture.
