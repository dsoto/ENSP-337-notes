# Ideal Model Representations

## Ideal voltage source

No matter how much current it provides, the voltage stays the same.

## Ideal temperature difference

This is also called a thermal reservoir.
No matter how much heat flow this "reservoir" provides, the temperature stays the same.

## Ideal current source

No matter the voltage, the current stays the same.

## Ideal heater

Creates the same amount of heat flow, no matter the temperature difference.

# Correspondence between thermal and electrical

- Heat flow (power) -- Electrical Current
- Temperature difference -- Voltage difference


## Ohms Law

$$V = IR$$

## Thermal Heat Flow

$$ q = UA \Delta T $$

Think of $q$ as current.
Think of $\Delta T$ as voltage.
Think of $1/UA$ as resistance.

$$ \Delta T = q \frac{1}{UA}$$
