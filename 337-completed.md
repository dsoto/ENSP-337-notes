## Physical Quantities
- Our numbers are often helping us represent physical quantities
- Examples:
    - The length of a tree
    - The number of animals observed
    - The number of molecules of mercury in a fish
- A physical quantity is expressed as the product of a unit and a
  numerical factor

## Dimensions
- These physical quantities often have a dimension
- Examples:
    - Length
    - Time
    - Mass

## Units
- To quantify dimensions, we use units
- One dimension may have multiple units
- Length: inches, miles, kilometers, light-years
- Mass: grams, pounds, kilograms
- There are also systems of units like SI or English

## Measurement
- Each measurement we make is an estimation of the physical quantity

## Consequences
- NASA Mars Climate Orbiter destroyed because of newton vs pounds of
force
- A cargo flight was lost in 1999 when crew confused meters and feet


## Unit conversion factors
- These factors are equivalent to one or unity and are dimensionless
- They are not numerically equal to one in most cases.
- Units can be crossed out


## Written
- Explanation of unit factor with inches and centimeters


## Unit Factor

$$ 1 \textrm{inch} = 2.54 \textrm{cm} $$
Dividing, we get
$$ \frac{2.54\textrm{cm}}{\textrm{inch}} = 1 $$
Note that 2.54 does not equal one, but with the units the two physical
quantities of length are equal.


## Combinations of units
- We often combine units to express new quantities


## Energy vs Power

- Power is the rate of energy transfer or delivery
- Average power is the amount of energy transferred or converted divided
  by the time spent


## Energy Units
- Joule
    - SI Unit.  One Newton-Meter.
- Kilowatt-Hour
    - Energy consumed by 1 kW load over one hour
- Calorie
    - Energy to heat one gram of water one degree Celsius
- Kilo-calorie
    - One thousand calories.  Used in food energy content.
- British Thermal Unit (BTU)
    - Energy to heat one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit
- Quad
    - One quadrillion ($10^{15}$) BTU
- Therm
    - 100,000 BTU

## Numerical Computing Environment

- Matlab
- Scientific Python
- Julia
- Sage Math Cloud

<!-- There is a subtle difference between computer programming and numerical -->
<!-- computing. -->

## Sage Math Cloud

- How many folks have signed up?
- Review homework template on SMC

## Basic computations

Most mathematical software uses the following symbols for basic
arithmetic.

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Exponentiation (^ or **)

To perform basic calculations with numbers, we can type numbers into the
computer and use the symbols above to perform the calculation.

In the Jupyter notebook, press shift-enter to evaluate a cell.


## Scientific Notation

$$6 \cdot 10^3$$ is entered as ``6E3``.


## Cells

We place a group of computations together in a cell.

## Variables

To make the details of a computation more clear, we can use readable
names for our numbers and then use the names in the calculation.  Most
mathematical software use this simple syntax.

    power = 100
    time = 30
    energy = power * time

This makes the intention of the calculation more clear to the reader.

## Functions

A custom function can be created and used.  The syntax for this often
varies but the idea is usually the same.

For Julia:

    m = 1
    b = 10
    f(x) = m * x + b

Python has a different syntax but it is the same idea.


## Narration

- You can add text and mathematics to your document
- ``# Title`` makes bold text
- ``$$ \frac{1}{2} $$`` creates mathematics $$ \frac{1}{2} $$


## Units

Computation of physical quantities often relies on the human to define
and use a consistent set of units of measurement.  There are tools that
allow us to add physical quantities to our calculations, but they are
not as rich as I could like them to be.  One good practice is to
explicitly include the unit name in the variable name.

    power_watt = 100
    time_sec = 30
    energy_joule = power_watt * time_sec

<!-- excel has custom formats for units? -->

## Units

There are also computer libraries that allow you to include units in the
definition of your variables.

- Pint python library

<!-- show pint examples -->

## Activity

- Create a Sage Math Cloud account
- Access the homework assignment


# Lecture 05

## ENSP 337, Lecture 5, Topic

**Professor Daniel Soto, Sonoma State University**

**14 Sep 2015**



## Learning Objectives

- Calculate equivalent sums of money using discount rates

## Announcements

- Sept 15th Grad apps for Fall semester
- Sept 19th DREAMer Conference
- Oct 21st Sustainability Day at the Student Center
    - David Orr keynote
    - Lucy Gudiel-Hernandez, vulnerable populations
    - Chris Fadeff
- Oct 26th SOURCE Awards Undergraduate Research/Creative Project Grant Program application due
    - http://www.sonoma.edu/source/grants/student.html
- Oct 30th ENSP application due
- Dec 4th UC Berkeley Energy Resources Group grad school application
- Jan 15th CSU Humboldt Energy Technology and Policy grad school application


## Concepts
- Time Value of Money
- Equivalence and Comparison Principle
- Net Present Value (NPV)
- Future Value
- Discounting
- Discount rate
- Interest rate


## Equivalence principle
- Given a choice between money now and money later, most demand a larger
  value at a later date
- When someone is indifferent between sum 1 now and sum 2 at a fixed
  later date, the sums are considered equivalent
- This equivalence can be expressed using a discount rate


## Discount Rate and Net Present Value
$$\textrm{Present Value (USD)} =
\frac
{\textrm{Future Amount (USD)}}
{(1 + \textrm{Discount Rate})^{\textrm{number of years in future}} }$$

$$P = \frac {F} {(1 + i)^{n} }$$


## Present Value Notation
Single payment
$$ PV = \frac{C}{(1+i)^n} $$

Stream of payments
$$ PV = C_0 +
        \frac{C_1}{1+i} +
        \frac{C_2}{(1+i)^2} +
        \dots +
        \frac{C_N}{(1+i)^N}$$

Compact notation
$$ PV = \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n}$$


## Discount rate vs. Interest rate

- Discount rate usually refers to personal preferences
- Interest rate is usually a real rate charged by a bank

## Monthly vs. Yearly interest rates

- Many types of loans advertise a yearly interest rate, but charge
    interest monthly.
- The yearly interest rate is the APR or annual percentage rate
- To find the monthly rate divide this by twelve
- $i$ is the annual percentage rate
- $n$ is the number of periods in months

$$ FV = PV (1 + i/12)^{n} $$



## Cash flow diagrams
![Cash Flow Diagram](../figures/cash-flow.png)


## NPV Spreadsheet Example
<!-- create a net present value calculation -->
<!-- show by hand and with NPV function -->

- Excel considers first value in the NPV function to be year 1

## Loan Spreadsheet Example

- You can arrive at a loan payment by trial and error in a spreadsheet.



# Lecture 6, Time Value of Money


## ENSP 337, Lecture 6, Time Value of Money

**Professor Daniel Soto, Sonoma State University**

**16 Sep 2015**


## Learning Objectives

- Able to use the internal rate of return (IRR) to quantify an energy investment
- Able to use the capital recovery function (CRF) to estimate a loan
    payment
- Recognize cost of conserved energy (CCE) and  cost of conserved carbon


## Review

- Discounting
- Time Value of Money
- NPV

<!-- do you want an NPV to be positive or negative? -->


## Concepts
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- Capital Recovery Function (CRF)
- Spreadsheet solution for CRF
- Inflation


## Internal Rate of Return
- Tells us at what interest rate a cash flow has a net present value of
  zero
- We will look at this on a spreadsheet
- This doesn't have a closed-form solution
- Usually solved by a computer


## IRR
Finding the IRR is the equivalent of asking, here is a loan, what was
the interest rate you got?


## Capital Recovery Factor
Suppose we make a loan.  We want to know what the yearly payment is so
that the present value of all payments is equal to the loan amount.

This formula allows us to calculate this payment.

$$CRF = \frac {i(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n-1}$$


## Inflation

- The cost of goods usually rises over time
- This rate is monitored by the [Consumer Price Index](http://www.bls.gov/cpi/)
- As prices rise, the value of money decreases


## Inflation

$$ 1 + r_0 = \frac{1+r}{1+f} $$

- $r_0$ is the effective rate of interest
- $r$ is the nominal rate of interest
- $f$ is the inflation rate

For small inflation rates,

$$ r_0 \approx r - f $$


## CRF Spreadsheet Example
<!-- show by hand and with PMT function -->
<!-- compare to calculator online -->

- Excel PMT
- Excel IRR


<!-- ## CRF Scripting Example -->
<!--  -->
<!-- &#45; np.pmt() -->
<!-- &#45; np.irr() -->


# Lecture 7, Energy and Power and Heat

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and calculate heat capacity to find energy needed to raise
    temperatures

## Review

- Power
- Energy
- Heat
- Units

## Heat
- Heat is the flow of this energy from one area to another
- Conduction
- Convection
- Radiation


## Intensive vs Extensive Properties

- Intensive or bulk property
    - Does not depend on the amount of material
    - Example: temperature, density
- Extensive property
    - Depends on the amount of material
    - Example: mass, volume


## Temperature
- Measure of the internal energy in a system or material
- This energy is the motion, vibration, or rotation of atoms and
  molecules


## Temperature Scales
![](../figures/temperature_scales.jpg)


## Heat Capacity

- When heat moves from one material to another one temperature rises the
    other falls
- The change in temperature is dictated by the heat capacity
- Ratio of heat added to temperature change


## Heat Capacity

- Extensive property
- Measured in Joules per degree Kelvin


## Specific Heat Capacity

- Intensive property
- Measured in Joules per mass per degree Kelvin


## Table of Specific Heat Values

| Material | Heat Capacity (Joule/gram/kelvin) |
| --       | --                                |
| Air      | 1                                 |
| Water    | 4.1813                            |
| Iron     | 0.45                              |
| Aluminum | 0.897                             |
| Brick    | 0.840                             |
| Wood     | 1.2 - 2.9                         |

Partial list from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity


## Heat capacity

$$ Q = mc\Delta T $$

- $Q$ is energy transferred to or from substance
- $m$ is the mass
- $c$ is the specific heat capacity
- $\Delta T$ is the temperature change


## Relation to Buildings

- Thermal mass is added to a building to store heat


## Relation to Weather and Climate

- The heat capacity of water affects the climate in some areas


## Activity

- Can we estimate the power of the tea kettle?

    volume = 1 liter
    mass_water = 1000 gram
    time = 5 * 60 sec => 300 sec
    heat_capacity = 4.186 joule/gram/kelvin
    temperature_change = 75 kelvin

    mass_water * heat_capacity
    * temperature_change / time in watt => 1,046.5 watt

This is very close to our measure value of 1300 watts.

## Planck's law

This law relates the intensity of power at each wavelength with the temperature
of an object (ideal black-body).

$$B_\lambda(\lambda, T) =\frac{2 hc^2}{\lambda^5}\frac{1}{ e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k_\mathrm{B}T}} - 1} $$

## Stefan-Boltzmann law

- What predicts the total radiant power from a hot object?

## Stefan-Boltzmann law

This law relates the total power emitted to the temperature, surface area, and emissivity of an object.

$$ P = A \epsilon \sigma T^4 $$

## Emissivity

The emissivity is how much radiant power is emitted by a substance relative to
an ideal black-body emitter.

## Concepts
- Temperature
- Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin Scale
- Heat Capacity
- First Law of Thermodynamics
- Second Law of Thermodynamics
- Energy Efficiency

## Concepts
- Carnot cycle heat engine
- Carnot refrigerator
- Carnot efficiency
- Coefficient of performance for refrigeration
- Coefficient of performance for heating
- What is the carbon difference for heat pump vs combustion


## Temperature
- Measure of the internal energy in a system or material
- This energy is the motion, vibration, or rotation of atoms and
  molecules

## Heat Engine
- Heat engines convert thermal energy to mechanical kinetic energy
- This conversion can never be 100 percent efficient

## Heat Engine
- Coal power plant turbines
- Internal combustion engines

## Heat Engines
- The heat engine is a mathematical model
- Takes the heat (flow) between two thermal reservoirs and converts some of
  that heat to work
- Heat can come from combustion or natural sources of heat

## Heat Engines
- A heat engine is more efficient when it uses a wider temperature range
    between the hot and cold sides

## Second Law of Thermodynamics
- The amount of entropy (disorder) in a closed system always increases
- Heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold
- "You can't break even"

## Thermodynamic limit to heat engine
- Carnot derived the upper limit of efficiency for a heat engine
$$\eta = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}$$
- This law dictates the maximum possible efficiency for power plants
- Some of the heat must be released into the environment

<!--
what happens when T_C goes to zero?
what happens when T_C and T_H are close to each other?
-->

## Carnot Heat Engine
- The most efficient heat engine possible uses a Carnot cycle
- Heat is used to expand a gas and do work and heat is removed during
  the compression of the gas.

## Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
- If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system,
  they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.
- Real world example: Coffee gets cold, ice cream melts

## First Law of Thermodynamics
- Energy is conserved
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed
- "You can't get something for nothing"

## First Law Efficiency
- Most commonly used measure of efficiency
- Useful energy out divided by total energy in

## Coefficient of Performance
![](../figures/COP-heat-pump.png)

## Maximum COP

For refrigeration
$$ COP_R = \frac{T_C}{T_H - T_C} $$

For a heat pump
$$ COP_{HP} = \frac{T_H}{T_H - T_C} $$
